# Code of Conduct

So we all get along.

1. Be nice and professional. Even if the other person isn't.
2. Be helpful, even if the other person is asking a presumably stupid question.
3. If you attack, attack the idea, not the person.
4. If you see something, [say something](https://pasztor.at/contact).
5. If someone is mean to you, do not escalate and leave moderation to the moderators.
6. Personal attacks of any sort will not be tolerated. You've been warned.
